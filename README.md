# Go Adventure App
The Go Adventure app is centered around simplifying your cultural travel itinerary. With a simple search you can find all monuments located in a city and save any or all of them to your personal list.

# User Stories
* When you arrive on the Go Adventure website you will be prompted to create a user log-in. This log-in will allow you to save the monuments that you've searched, and add comments to each individual one. 
* These comments can be added before your trip to remind yourself of certain facts or details that you would like to see once there, or after your trip if you want to write down certain facts that you learned from your visit. You can also edit or remove these comments at any time.
* If your travel plans change then the delete button is there to completely remove an individual monument that you had saved on your personal page.
* As a user, you can update your profile settings by changing your email address, password, or delete your account all together.
